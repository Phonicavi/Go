具体编译时还需要修改
	1. 目前已经把libgcc和libstdc++两个库添加到了静态链接
	2. engine.cpp中playouts和max_time两个参数需要重新设置


Hara is a GTP go (igo, weiqi, baduk) engine written in C++.


USAGE

Hara runs as a console application and can be used with any go GUI that supports the GTP protocol.


ALGORITHM

The engine uses a Monte Carlo algorithm with AMAF, RAVE, MoGo patterns, ladder reading, and other heuristics.


NAME

Hara could refer to an early name of Shiva, that can be translated as "one who captivates", "one who consolidates", and "one who destroys". But truth is that it is only a pretty given name.
